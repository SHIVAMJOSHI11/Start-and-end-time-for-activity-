This file is originally created on Google colab
And can be used on python also just replace !pip install... to pip install remove ! sign
u can open py file and do this one change
There are 2-3 simple changes which I have written above small part of codes for which changes have to be made according to your uploaded video
i have also given instructions on how to upload video
u will get start and end time of different activities and u have to select which activities start and end time u have see
u have to write stop to stop execution of code
so it can be used for daily purposes also
u will also get the graph of the probablities at every second of video at which activity is happening
u can also change threshold so that u get activities even at lower probablities,according to your use
